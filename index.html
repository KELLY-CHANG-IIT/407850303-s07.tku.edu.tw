        <h2 class="text-center"><u><strong><font color="green">About Me</font></strong></u></h2> 
        <p class="w-50 mx-auto"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Both dynamic and static are my areas of participation, and I actively participate in related competitions and develop multiple interests. I have always liked the implementation very much. I participated in the science exhibition with the encouragement of the middle school teacher. I got excellent results and went to participate in competitions on behalf of the school. In high school, even though the academic pressure has increased a lot, I still have the spirit of studying well. In addition to actively participating in many competitions, and participating in activity training camps, to further understand the detailed scope of various fields, and to find the future path through the activities, to develop towards the direction of professional leadership, and to be inspired by high school teachers, bury Seeds of interest in the development of the engineering community, and exposure to a variety of different things. Although I felt a little confused when I was in college, I did n’t even know if I was really suitable for information technology. However, I was guided by the director of the department to take me to relevant courses and use my expertise to double-improve My strength. Since I was a child, I grew up independently because of the environment at home. I am curious about my personality and because my parents do n’t have many resources. So I often explore and find answers to my own problems. Although this is a problem for many people, It may be tiring or a waste of time, but for me, this is a step that allows me to make a great leap forward and achieve a sense of accomplishment.</font></p>
